# SeaIce.jl

*Package for particle-based simulation of sea-ice dynamics*

## Package features

Flexible and computationally efficient 2d implementation of the discrete element method.  The particles represent sea-ice floes, which can be forced by ocean and velocity fields.  The ice floes can interact through elasto-viscous-frictional contact rheologies and obtain time-dependent tensile strength.
